        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Made up of a <strong>&lt;form&gt;</strong> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus, and buttons.</li>
            <li>Traditionally processed on the backend, now commonly processed on the front end using JavaScript</li>
            <li><strong>form.submit()</strong> submits the form automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>form.reset()</strong> will reset all the form controls back to their initial values. 
                A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this.
                Be cautious when using rest buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>form.action</strong> sets the action attribute of a form so it is sent to a a different URL to be processed on the server.</li>
            <li>Focus and blure can be used to remove and add default text to the text field - similar to the placeholder attribute.</li>
            <li>Common form controls are input, select, textarea, and button.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Form Validation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly.</li>
            <li>Can occur on the client side using JavaScript and on the server side. Advisable to use both.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Often used to model representations of objects in the real world.</li>
            <li>There are three main concepts in OOP: polymorphism, and inheritance.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Encapsulation - keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it's done.</li>
                <li>Polymorphism - various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
                <li>Inheritance - we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul><br>     

        <h3><strong><i>JavaScript Novice to Ninja: Chapter 15</i></strong></h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>Modular JavaScript</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
            <li>The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with disctinct functionality.</li>
            <li>Keeping code modular helps to make it more loosely coupled and interchangeable.</li>
            <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.</li>
            <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
            <li>The value of <strong>this</strong> in the top level of a module is <strong>undefined</strong>, rather than the global object.</li>
            <li>The keyword <strong>export</strong> is used to specify any values or functions that are to be made available from the module.</li>
            <li>The keyword <strong>import</strong> is then used to import those values or functions inside another js file.</li>
            <li>Use the the wildcard symbol * with a namespace to import a large amount of values and/or functions.</li>
        </ul>
