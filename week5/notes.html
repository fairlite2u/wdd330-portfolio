        <h3><strong><cite>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</cite> Chapter 10:</strong> Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Errors are cause when something goes wrong in a program, whether a system error, programmer error, or
                user error.</li>
            <li>System errors mean there is a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
                interacting. This can be difficult to fix but we should be aware of them and attempt to reduce their
                impact by working around any problems they cause.</li>
            <li>Programmer errors are our responsibility and we must minimize and fix them - they could be incorrect
                syntax, faulty logic, or typos.</li>
            <li>User errors could be considered programmer errors so we should try to predict any possible interactions
                that might throw an error and provide a solution that doens't negatively affect the user experience.
            </li>
            <li>Exceptions are errors that produce a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the
                error.</li>
            <li>An exception will also produce a <strong>stack trace</strong>, which is a sequence of functions or
                method calls that lead to the point where the error occured. It will work backwards from point where the
                error occurred to find the original function or method that started the sequence.</li>
            <li>Warnings can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. The
                program will continue to run after the warning but the issue that produced the warning may cause the
                program to continue running incorrectly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Errors that fail silently in the background make them difficult to spot and longer to track down.</li>
            <li>Ensure that code in development fails loudly so that errors can be identified and fixed quickly.</li>
            <li>Any errors in code that is in productions should fail gracefully so that the user experience is not
                affected, if possible.</li>
            <li>Make sure exceptions a caught and dealt with and code is tested rigorously.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
            </li>
            <li>Helps spot more errors early on.</li>
            <li>Writing in strict mode can help improve code's clarity and speed.</li>
            <li>Encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written, so its use is recommended</li>
            <li>To use strict mode, add <code>'use strict';</code> to the first line of a JavaScript file.</li>
            <li>The recommended way to invode strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function. This
                is especially helpful when using someone else's code so that only your code is forced to use strict
                mode.</li>
            <li>Modules are in strict mode by default.</li>
            <li>Linting tools can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code beyond strict mode. They are useful for
                enforcing a programming style guide.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done
                by using an <code>if</code> statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to
                actually call the method.</li>
            <li>Feature detection guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and fails gracefully,
                without any exceptions being thrown, if the method doesn't exist.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. Errors
                often originate in a different place than when they occur.</li>
            <li>Breakpoints can be created to halt the progress of the code so we can view the value of different
                variables at that point in the program.</li>
            <li>You can use the <code>alert()</code> method to show a dialog at certain points in the code to check the
                value of variables at those points. However, this is now discouraged since new debugging tools have been
                developed.</li>
            <li><code>console.log()</code> can also be used. It won't stop the execution of the program like
                <code>alert()</code> but can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the porgram.
            </li>
            <li><code>console.trace()</code> will log an interactive stack trace in the console.</li>
            <li>The <code>debugger</code> keyword can be used inside your code to create breakpoints to pause the
                execution of the code. Just make sure to remove any references to the <code>debugger</code> command
                before deployment of code!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Error Objects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An <code>error</code> object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can
                be created in the code using a constructor function. The parameter is used as the error message.</li>
            <li>There are several error objects that can be used, including: <code>Error, RangeError, ReferenceError,
                    SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError,</code> and <code>InternalError</code>.</li>
            <li>These error objects can also be used as constructors to create custome error objects.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to throw your own exceptions using the <code>throw</code> statement. This will allow
                for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Exception handling allows you to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Then errors can be
                hidden from user, but still identified. The error can then be dealt with while keeping the program
                running.</li>
            <li>For pieces of code that may result in an exception, we can wrap them in a <code>try</code> block.</li>
            <li>If an exception occurs, it will pass the error object that is thrown into a <code>catch</code> block.
            </li>
            <li>The code inside the <code>catch</code> block will only run if an exception is thrown inside the
                <code>try</code> block.</li>
            <li>A <code>finally</code> block can be added after the <code>catch</code> block that will always be
                executed after the <code>try</code> or <code>catch</code> block whether an exception occurred or not.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tests</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked.</li>
            <li>Test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Then writing some code to make the tests pass.</li>
            <li>Here is a workflow for TDD:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Test-driven development is considered to be best practice but isn't always used. Any tests are better than no tests.</li>
            <li>Testing frameworks like Jest provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them.</li>
        </ul>
