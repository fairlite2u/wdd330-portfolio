        <h2>Week 1 Notes</h2>
        <h3><strong><i>Doing Stuff With Web Things</i></strong></h3>
        <p>* Think, Design, Test, Create - not the "Oh Crap!" method.</p>
        <p>* HTML - define the stuff to be shown to the user.</p>
        <p>* CSS - make the stuff shown pleasant to see.</p>
        <p>* JavaScript - make the user experience interactive rather than passive.</p>
        <p>* Make things describable as a function for practice, i.e. takeShower or makeDinner</p>
        <p>* Figure out what, if anything, is going in, what, if anything, is coming out, and what may be happening as part of what is being done.</p>
        <p>* Always give a function a name that is a verb.</p>
        <p>* If you are dealing with an <strong>input</strong> or <strong>textarea</strong> use value; a <strong>section</strong>, use innerHTML.</p>
        <p>* Think about key-value pairs & describe them, i.e. in gradebooks, the student name is the key, the grades are the values.</p>
        <p>* Make sure you use == to compare if two things are equal and = to put something in a variable.</p>
        <p>* != means "not equal to"; ! means NOT; && mean AND.</p>
        <p>* The parseInt function tries to convert any text to an integer.</p>
        <p>* NaN means "not a number".</p>
        <p>* isNan function can be used to determine if input is "not a number".</p>
        <p>* The standard for loop parts when working with an array are: 
            <ol>
                <li>The <strong>for</strong> keyword</li>
                <li>A variable to keep track of the location you are at in the array</li>
                <li>A check to see if the loop should continue</li>
                <li>An update that increases the location tracking variable by one</li>
                <li>The lines of code to execute everytime you go around the loop</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
