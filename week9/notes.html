        <h3><strong><cite>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</cite> Chapter 9:</strong> The Window Object</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Browser Object Model is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the
                browser and computer screen.</li>
            <li>These properties and moethos are made available through the <code><strong>window</strong></code> object.
            </li>
            <li>Global variables are created without using the <code>const, let,</code> or <code>var</code> keywords and
                are actual properties of the global object which means they are also properties of the
                <code>window</code> object.</li>
            <li><code>window</code> object functions that produce dialogs: <code>alert(), confirm(), prompt()</code>.
                These methods should be user with care becuase they stop the executions of a program in its tracks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Browser Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>window</code> object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the
                user's browser including <code>navigator</code> and <code>location</code>. These also have their own
                properties that provide more information, including:</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li><code>window.navigator.userAgent</code> - Returns information about the brower and operating system
                    being used. This property has been deprecated from the official specification, but remains well
                    supported in all major browsers.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.href</code> - Returns the full URL as a string.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.protocol</code> - Returns a string describing the protocol used.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.host</code> - Returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and
                    the port number (which is often omitted if the default port 80 is used).</li>
                <li><code>window.location.pathname</code> - Returns a string of the path that follows the domain.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.assign()</code> - Can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as
                    a parameter.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Most of those properties are read/write, which means they can also be changed by assignment.</li>
            <li>The <code>window.history</code> property can be used to access information about any previously visited
                pages in the current browser session, not to be confused with the HTML5 History API.</li>
            <li>The <code>window.screen</code> object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.
                Things like height, width, available height and width, and color bit depth can be found. The
                <code>screen</code> object has more uses for mobile devices.</li>
            <li>Many of these methods and properties should be used with care as they have been abused in the past.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Document Object</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>document</code> object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded
                into the window. Here are a few methods worth looking at:</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li><code>document.write</code> - Writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it
                    will completely replace the current document. You can also include HTML in the string and it will
                    become part of the DOM tree. Placing the method within a document inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags
                        will inject the string into the markup and not overwrite the rest of the HTML on the page. The
                        use of <code>document.write</code> is heavily frowned upon and there are only rare legitimate
                        uses of it.</li>
                <li><code>document.cookie</code> - Used to create a cookie which is a list of name/value pairs. Cookies
                    are used to allow a browser to retrieve information between
                    requests to remember user's previous visits. Using cookes for data storage is being replaced by the
                    HTML5 localStorage API in many cases, but cookies are still useful for retaining state information
                    such as if a user is logged in.</li>
                <li><code>document.write</code></li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>window.setTimeout()</code> method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second paramenter.</li>
            <li><code>window.clearTimeout()</code> will prevent the timeout if called before the setTimeout parameters are met.</li>
            <li>The <code>window.setInterval()</code> method will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
            <li><code>window.clearInterval()</code> will stop the setInterval method.</li>
            <li><code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> can be used to animate elements on a web page, although not as well as <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code>.</li>
            <li><code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code> has a much smoother performance.</li>
            <li>In general, it is typically better to use CSS for any animation effects, although there may be times when JavaScript might be the better solution.</li>
        </ul><br>




        <h3><strong><cite>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</cite> Chapter 14:</strong> HTML5 APIs</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>The <code>data-</code> Attribute</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.</li>
            <li>They are private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service - their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
            <li>When naming these attributes, they must use the following format:</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li>Start with <code>date-</code>.</li>
                <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons, or underscores.</li>
                <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</li>
            <li>Browsers that support the Web Storage API have a <code>window</code> object property called <code>localStorage</code> that has several properties and methods that are used to store data.</li>
            <li>There is also a <code>sessionStorage</code> object that works like <code>localStorage</code> but the data is only saved for the current session.</li>
            <li>Basics of using <code>localStorage</code>:</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li>To set and item and then retrieve it's value, you can use <code>localStorage.setItem('name', 'value')</code> and <code>localStorage.getItem('name')</code>.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can use assignment, for example: <code>localStorage.name = 'value'</code>.</li>
                <li>To remove something from local storage you can use the <code>removeItem</code> method or the <code>delete</code> operator or you can remove everything using the <code>clear</code> method.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Geolocation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.</li>
            <li>Permission to use this has to be granted by the user first, due to privacy concerns.</li>
            <li>Geolocation is a property of the <code>navigator</code> object.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Web Workers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since JavaScript is a single-threaded language, web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The <code>Worker()</code> constructor function is used to create a new worker: <code>const worker = new Worker('task.js');</code>.</li>
            <li>The function takes another JavaScript file as an argument and downloads it. Once the file has downloaded completely, the worker will start.</li>
            <li>The variable that is assigned to the constructor function is used to refer to the worker in the main program, the keyword <code>self</code> is used to refer to the worker in the worker script.</li>
            <li>Web worker use the concept of messages to communicate back and forth between the main script and the worker script.</li>
            <li><code>worker.terminate()</code> is used to stop a worker from inside the main code or <code>self.close()</code> in used from inside the worker script.</li>
            <li>Shared web workers can also be created to allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object.</li>
            <li>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Websockets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Websocket is a protocol that allows two-way communication with a server - also know as push messaging.</li>
            <li>Check out websocket.org for more ways to use websockets and to learn more about them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications.</li>
            <li>Permission must be granted by the user to send notifications, which can be achieved by using the <code>requestPermission() method.</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Multimedia</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 introduced the <code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> tags to insert audio and video clips into a web page, along with a Media API for controlling the clips.</li>
            <li>The audio and video elements bring native support for multimedia into the browser and the API gives developers full control of the playback of audio and video.</li>
        </ul>
