        <h3><strong><cite>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</cite> Chapter 9:</strong> The Window Object</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Browser Object Model is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the
                browser and computer screen.</li>
            <li>These properties and moethos are made available through the <code><strong>window</strong></code> object.
            </li>
            <li>Global variables are created without using the <code>const, let,</code> or <code>var</code> keywords and
                are actual properties of the global object which means they are also properties of the
                <code>window</code> object.</li>
            <li><code>window</code> object functions that produce dialogs: <code>alert(), confirm(), prompt()</code>.
                These methods should be user with care becuase they stop the executions of a program in its tracks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Browser Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>window</code> object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the
                user's browser including <code>navigator</code> and <code>location</code>. These also have their own
                properties that provide more information, including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>window.navigator.userAgent</code> - Returns information about the brower and operating system
                    being used. This property has been deprecated from the official specification, but remains well
                    supported in all major browsers.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.href</code> - Returns the full URL as a string.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.protocol</code> - Returns a string describing the protocol used.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.host</code> - Returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and
                    the port number (which is often omitted if the default port 80 is used).</li>
                <li><code>window.location.pathname</code> - Returns a string of the path that follows the domain.</li>
                <li><code>window.location.assign()</code> - Can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as
                    a parameter.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Most of those properties are read/write, which means they can also be changed by assignment.</li>
            <li>The <code>window.history</code> property can be used to access information about any previously visited
                pages in the current browser session, not to be confused with the HTML5 History API.</li>
            <li>The <code>window.screen</code> object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.
                Things like height, width, available height and width, and color bit depth can be found. The
                <code>screen</code> object has more uses for mobile devices.</li>
            <li>Many of these methods and properties should be used with care as they have been abused in the past.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Document Object</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>document</code> object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded
                into the window. Here are a few methods worth looking at:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>document.write</code> - Writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it
                    will completely replace the current document. You can also include HTML in the string and it will
                    become part of the DOM tree. Placing the method within a document inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags
                        will inject the string into the markup and not overwrite the rest of the HTML on the page. The
                        use of <code>document.write</code> is heavily frowned upon and there are only rare legitimate
                        uses of it.</li>
                <li><code>document.cookie</code> - Used to create a cookie which is a list of name/value pairs. Cookies
                    are used to allow a browser to retrieve information between
                    requests to remember user's previous visits. Using cookes for data storage is being replaced by the
                    HTML5 localStorage API in many cases, but cookies are still useful for retaining state information
                    such as if a user is logged in.</li>
                <li><code>document.write</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>window.setTimeout()</code> method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second paramenter.</li>
            <li><code>window.clearTimeout()</code> will prevent the timeout if called before the setTimeout parameters are met.</li>
            <li>The <code>window.setInterval()</code> method will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
            <li><code>window.clearInterval()</code> will stop the setInterval method.</li>
            <li><code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> can be used to animate elements on a web page, although not as well as <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code>.</li>
            <li><code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code> has a much smoother performance.</li>
            <li>In general, it is typically better to use CSS for any animation effects, although there may be times when JavaScript might be the better solution.</li>
        </ul><br>
